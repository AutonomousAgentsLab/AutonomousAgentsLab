*PhD Student (Graduate School of Education)*

Anya is a Ph.D. student in the Learning Sciences and Technology Design program at Stanford, co-advised by Jason Yeatman and Nick Haber. She received her B.S. in Computer Science and Teaching Chemistry 7-12 from New York University and M.S.Ed in Learning Sciences and Technologies from the University of Pennsylvania. Anyaâ€™s previous research focused on science education and learning analytics under the guidance of Susan Kirch, Camillia Matuk, and Ryan Baker. After teaching middle school chemistry for two years in Brooklyn, NY, she became more interested in developing computational learning tools to support children with special needs. At Stanford, Anya is excited to explore adaptive reading assessments and interventions for children with varied reading abilities.
