### Eric Zelikman

_PhD Student (Computer Science)_

Eric Zelikman is a CS PhD student fascinated by how (and whether) algorithms learn meaningful representations and reason, with a particular interest in the way that we can apply inspiration from neuroscience and curiosity. Eric particularly cares about problems which require symbolic, compositional, and multi-step representations, and hopes that machine learning can also teach us about non-machine learning.
