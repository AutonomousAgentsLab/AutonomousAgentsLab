### Samaher Radwan

*Research Coordinator*

Sama graduated from Emory University with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology and a minor in Spanish, with a focus in linguistics. She completed her honors thesis exploring dissociable cognitive and neural systems for recognizing scenes and navigating through them. Using interdisciplinary approaches, she is interested in studying both the development of language and cognitive systems as well as their breakdown in typically developing children and patient populations, in order to create inclusive, accessible diagnostic and pedagogical tools.
