### Logan Cross

*Postdoctoral Fellow*

Logan received a B.S. from University of Southern California (Neuroscience) and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology (Computation and Neural Systems). During his graduate work, he worked with John Oâ€™Doherty and studied how the human brain makes decisions in complex domains by using cutting-edge methods in neuroimaging and machine learning. Logan also completed an internship at Google DeepMind, where he build deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve a challenging a meta-learning benchmark. His research broadly examines how intelligence arises in humans and can be built in machines by combining approaches and insights from a variety of disciplines, including computational neuroscience, deep learning, and developmental psychology.
