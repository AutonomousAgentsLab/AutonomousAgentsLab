### Isaac Kauvar

*Postdoctoral Fellow*

Isaac Kauvar received a B.S. (Engineering Physics), M.S. (Electrical Engineering) and PhD (Electrical Engineering) from Stanford. During his graduate work, jointly in the labs of Gordon Wetzstein and Karl Deisseroth, he developed tools for recording cortex-wide neural activity in mice, and he applied these tools to discover how circuits throughout the brain of behaving mammals function as a coupled systemâ€”and the consequences that can arise when they decouple. As a postdoc, he is excited to explore the phenomenon of curiosity
